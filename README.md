# i-choose
A communication app for Android. Designed for children with learning disabilities.

BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are many children who struggle to communicate their needs verbally. e.g. children with autism, learning disabilities etc. A common communication method is to use cartoon-style picture symbols made out of paper, with which they can show a carer what they want or need. 

The aim of the app is to provide the same functionality as the paper symbols, in a digital form.

**SEPTEMBER 2018 UPDATE**

The functionality has been extended in the form of a web app as part of a joint project with Vicky Jackson ( https://github.com/vickyjackson ) See here for more details: https://github.com/Digory/i-choose-web-app

WHAT THE APP DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(See screenshots.pdf to see what it looks like.)

The main screen divides symbols into 3 categories: Food and Drink, Activities, and Toilet. I prioritised the toilet symbol as being in the main screen, and hence quickly available, my logic being that may be a symbol needed in a hurry. 

The user can navigate through the categories and find the appropriate symbol. Categories are further subdivided on the following screens. The example in the  screenshots shows a user navigating to "Orange". The route to get there is: FOOD AND DRINK -> SNACK -> ORANGE. The screen can be viewed in landscape or portrait mode. 

Once the user finds the symbol they want, they tap the symbol to enlarge it, and tap again to have the word spoken out loud by the app. So, in the screenshots.pdf example, the word "Orange" is said.
