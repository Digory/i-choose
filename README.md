A communication app for Android. Designed for children with learning disabilities.

BACKGROUND
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

My previous job involved working with children and young people with difficulties in communicating verbally. They would communicate using symbols, i.e. small pieces of laminated paper with pictures on them. For example, if a child needs to go to the toilet they can show an adult the "toilet" symbol, which has a clear, cartoon-style picture of a toilet and the word "toilet" on it.

There has been software developed for the Apple iPad to enable communication using similar principles. It uses the same symbols but on a screen. This is helpful as paper symbols are easily lost. Additionally it is much easier for a child to find the symbol they need in this way rather than searching through a large book of symbols.

Unfortunately, this software is expensive and requires a monthly subscription. It is mainly used in schools or other organisations, rather than something a family would typically buy, particularly if they are on a low income. The requirement to purchase an iPad (not cheap!) is another barrier.

This app aims to provide a free alternative, for Android. This is an ongoing project and any suggestions for improvement are appreciated! :-D

WHAT THE APP DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(See screenshots.pdf to see what it looks like.)

The main screen divides symbols into 3 categories: Food and Drink, Activities, and Toilet. I prioritised the toilet symbol as being in the main screen, and hence quickly available, my logic being that may be a symbol needed in a hurry. 

The user can navigate through the categories and find the appropriate symbol. Categories are further subdivided on the following screens. The example in the  screenshots shows a user navigating to "Orange". The route to get there is: FOOD AND DRINK -> SNACK -> ORANGE. The screen can be viewed in landscape or portrait mode. 

Once the user finds the symbol they want, they tap the symbol to enlarge it, and tap again to have the word spoken out loud by the app. So, in the screenshots.pdf example, the word "Orange" is said.
